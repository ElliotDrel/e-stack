## Skill Feedback

If the user shares feedback about this skill — a bug, something confusing, a missing feature, or a suggestion — ask them to describe it in a bit more detail (what they expected, what happened, and any relevant context). Then file the issue using whichever method is available:

**If `gh` is installed** (`gh --version` succeeds), create the issue directly:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --repo ElliotDrel/e-stack \
  --title "{{SKILL_NAME}}: <concise summary>" \
  --body "<description from user feedback — expected vs. actual behavior and context>"
```

**If `gh` is not installed**, build a pre-filled URL:

```bash
python3 -c "
import urllib.parse
title = '{{SKILL_NAME}}: <concise summary>'
body = '<description from user feedback — expected vs. actual behavior and context>'
base = 'https://github.com/ElliotDrel/e-stack/issues/new'
print(base + '?title=' + urllib.parse.quote(title) + '&body=' + urllib.parse.quote(body))
"
```

Share the printed URL with the user and offer to open it in their browser.

They can also click it directly, review the pre-filled title and body, and click **Submit new issue**.
